Test suite for the Mailman UI.
==============================

This document both acts as a test for all the functions implemented
in the UI as well as documenting what has been done.


Getting Started
===============

To start the test, import the django test client.

    >>> from django.test.client import Client

Then instantiate a test client.

    >>> c = Client()

Go to the start page listing all lists.

    >>> response = c.get('/',)

Make sure the load was a success by checking the status code.

    >>> #response.status_code
    200
